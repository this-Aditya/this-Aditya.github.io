							<p>Hey, What's up ü§† <br>
                                      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
									  As a developer, my life is not only specific to coding what I do. I am living a life and I enjoy it. I love hiking, cooking, singing(Honey Singh and Rahat Fateh Ali Khan are my favorite ones.), football, motorbiking, Photography, and Videography and there are so many fields I am loved in. I started coding a year ago and I got so overwhelmed by it. In starting it used to frighten me and as time passed I spend some precious time with my laptop I enjoyed the taste of it now I am fallen in love with coding. It will be absolutely fine if I am going to devote my whole life to programming. Now coming to my other aspects,
I love yoga and I have a strong belief in god. I want to live a healthy and conscious life, I guess that might be the reason I love spending time with myself. I love motorbike riding and my never-ending love for Royal Enfield bikes
üèçÔ∏è. I want to ride for days and nights, Sure it is going to happen soon. 
Yet I have a hidden talent for cooking, and I am confident about it that I cook very delicious stuff. If we met someday you should definitely give me a chance to my cooked food and you will love it.
I also am in love with many things it will take a very long if I keep discussing about them. Hope you didn't get bored while going through it.
 Thank You.  </p>
